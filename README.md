<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great leaderboard apps for ACC; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this. I wanted to create a leaderboard that enhanced my experience as a Driver and also provided valuable data to a League Commentator.

* RaceApp.eu intergration - Displaying historic results from previous races. Current and provisional Championship points and position updated live during the race.
* Advanced table filtering with conditions.
* URL parameters
* Intergrates with OBS using URL parameters.
